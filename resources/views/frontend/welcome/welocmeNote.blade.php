                            loving individuals, who visualized this platform to be the stairway to a weekend getaway for
                            cricket crazy people who are truly affectionate towards the game. The first tournament was
                            played by Cadet College Club Limited (CCCL), Grameen Phone (GP), Brac Bank (BB), British
                            American Tobacco (BATB), Banglalink and Bangla Trac. The tournament continued with the same
                            spirit till date with many new corporate houses taking part.
